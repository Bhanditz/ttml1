<p>This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers,
and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director
as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference
material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation
is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread
deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.</p>

<p>This version reflects changes made as a result of applying errata and addressing
comments received since the Recommendation was first published. With one minor
exception noted below, these changes are editorial.</p>
